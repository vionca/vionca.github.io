      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">I went to Coachella and still 've been struggling to describe my
        first-time Coachella experience ever since. It was a whirlwind.

        But all in all, Coachella was one of the most fun weekends of my
        life, and turned me into a full-blown festival addict. I went with my sister that is also my best friend and we were able to see many of our favorites artist. We saw amazing performances, such as, Eminem, Beyonce, Post Malone, Cardi B, Migos, Lany, Vance Joy
        and some others.


        When my sister, Mapi and I drove up to the campsite, I was shocked by how beautiful the grounds were. I had pictured a desert, not luscious green grass. It turns out the Coachella campgrounds are beautiful, backed by the quintessential Coachella scenery of palm
        trees and the Ferris Wheel.

        The atmosphere inside the festival was great. It was amazing to
        see all the outfits and different nationalities from all over the globe. Celebrities and famous bloggers all around Coachella. No doubt, one of the most memorable experience.
