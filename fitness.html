        <h3>How I ended in the fitness world</h3>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">When I was four years old I started playing tennis, doing flamenco, and dancing ballet at the same time. My mom wanted me to stay with dancing and music, but my passion was tennis; I had always dreamed of playing professionally. When I was 17 years old, I was injured
 in both of my knees; the damage was such that it did not let me play to the same way i had played when I was younger. Thus, I decided to keep going, but in a different way: my motivation now was learning about other physical activities that wouldnâ€™t hurt my
 knees. I started reading and informing myself about the fitness world. I am excited to share some routines that I created that really help me to have a healthy body without pain.</p>
      <a><h2 class="titlesfont" style="text-align: center">Some Daily Routines</h2></a>
