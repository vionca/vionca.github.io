 <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> When I visited the Art Basel in Miami, I was surprised to see all the various different art styles and artworks that we readily-available to the public. Unlike most artwork in my school, the University of Miami, which offers a wide variety of arts and styles and
 eras, the Art Basel is instead designed to showcase multiple different art styles and mediums, usually which were vastly different in style and development. While the majority of them followed a set style, to see so many different artists coming together to
 show their own art was very interesting, especially since it was a display of multiple art styles that were not usually shown at the Lowe Art Museum.


As an artist myself, I was very impressed by the selection of artwork that was on display: it served to inspire me and others to continue developing our own work on our art styles, regardless of how different it might have been from what was on display.
